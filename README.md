Hi!

# This is a simple nodejs RESTful APIs app with express framework.

First things need to do is:

1- Install NodeJs => https://nodejs.org/

2- Install npm globaly on your Os (windows - mac - ...)

``` npm i -g npm@6.14.3 ``` update to latest version

3- Install nodemon for run-watching mode 

(install command is : ```npm i -g nodemon ```)

I suggest to you install "nodemon" as globaly packages because it is a tool not a dependency for project

So now! you must install dependency packages: (please run below command in project folder)

``` npm i ```


Welldone! app is ready to run now. run below command

``` nodemon index.js ```

tadaaa!

open browser: "localhost:5000"  (must see hello :))

open browser: "localhost:5000/api/courses" (must see course array list)

You can use Postman to Get,Post,Put,Delete Courses operators

Enjoyed.
